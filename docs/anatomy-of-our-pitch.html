                        <h2>Market...</h2>
                        <p>However, offering up some exhaustive listing of everyone and everything related to your venture is absolutely and positively <strong>NOT</strong> the objective of this presentation of the market.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Market...</h2>
                        <p>Instead, your objective when researching  the market-relevant portion of the pitch is to become so fully informed of the workings of this ecosystem that you can develop a coherent and concise explanation of <em><strong>what matters</strong></em> about the most relevant interactions among and actors within this system.</p>

                        <h2>Method</h2>
                        <p>The <em>Method</em> is the Technology of the venture. Technology, in this case, is with a capital &#8220;T,&#8221; implying not simply the tools but perhaps also the techniques through which your venture creates impact. Impact is something that hits your customers or communities in such a way that it changes their lives.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Method...</h2>
                        <p>Every venture has a technology. Technology, broadly defined, is the method(s) through which a venture converts inputs to outputs. For some ventures, these methods may involve real (or virtual) machines. For other ventures, these methods are performed by the hands of minds of employees (or even partners and communities).</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Method...</h2>
                        <p>Most importantly, and if at all possible, research and reveal evidence that clearly suggests the method you apply has or will (or at least is very likely) to have the impact you suggest. This sort of evidence is often in such high demand from investors that startups must demo if not already have launched, publicly or privately, some version of their product or service, leading to data that support key impact claims.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Method...</h2>
                        <p>The method of a venture, while at times presented on its own, can also be wrapped within the presentation of the model. When wrapped within the model, the method (how you venture creates impact) is usually expressed as a transformation — some change in the state of some thing that is made possible through the actions of your venture. For example: &#8220;After taking our course, students are able to score 50 points higher on the GMAT (on average).&#8221;</p>

                    <h2>Model</h2>
                    <p>The <em>Model</em>, sometimes referred to as the business model, of a venture is a detailed, insightful, evidence-based, and (therefore) credible explanation of how your venture creates impact, what the value of that impact might be, and how you intend upon capturing some if not all of this value. Please see <a title="Business Models" href="http://strtp.com/notes/functioning/models-and-rock-stars/">the note on business models</a> for a more thorough description.</p>
                    <p>Alternatively stated, and in the words of Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010, <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/businessmodelgeneration_preview.pdf">PDF link</a>), a business model &#8220;describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value.&#8221;</p>

                    <h2>Mortals</h2>
                    <p>The founders, early employees, advisors, board members, and even prior investors are the <em>Mortals</em> behind your venture. I chose to word mortal simply to make it clear that you should not present yourself and anyone else involved as a divine being. Instead, you are real people.</p>
                    <p>Don&#8217;t simply highlight the roles and qualifications certain individuals might play or possess. More importantly, describe the key contributions, experiences, and insights — in explicit terms — that support those roles and substantiate the qualifications.</p>
                    <p>What&#8217;s truly important about the real people involved with your venture would the contribution and experience that make these individuals most relevant to the viability if not the outright success of the startup.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Milestones</h2>
                    <p><em>Milestones</em> are the key events that have occurred or you anticipate to occur during the lifecycle of your venture. The timing (as in date and order) of these events is important. Equally, if not more important, is the reasoning behind these moments and their timing.</p>
                    <p>When communicating milestones, solid pitches tend to signal that the founder(s) can:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Breakdown a big, perhaps intractable challenge (e.g., building out a successful new venture!) into smaller, yet key and more accomplishable chunks;</li>
                        <li>Identify and test the most significant uncertainties or assumptions of the venture, the resolution or proof of which stand in the way of the success of the venture; and</li>
                        <li>Organize (1) and (2) according to a realistic and reasonable ordering and apportioning of time.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <section>
                        <h2 class="fragment highlight-green">Money</h2>
                        <p>Otherwise known as &#8220;the financials,&#8221; the <em>Money</em> is a realistic and reasoned presentation of the incomes, expenses, funding and potential valuations relevant to the survival and success of the firm. Ideally, a startup pitch will offer of four dimensions of the money: (1) a funding request, (2) an estimate of the exit or impact value, (3) a description of and explanation for key expense driver(s), and (4) a description of and explanation for key revenue driver(s).</p>
                        <p>Hitting all four of the above-mentioned buttons can be a real challenge, particularly during the initial and earliest stages of the company. Wise and intelligent investors understand this challenge. Therefore, startup pitches are (usually) not expected to be perfect predictions of the future. Instead, solid pitches are able to signal the following:</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Money...</h2>
                        <p>First, the founders have a well-reasoned understanding of how the venture &#8220;works.&#8221; That is to say that you recognize the so-called levers — sources of costs, revenues, etc. — that drive the financial viability of the firm, the characteristics of these levers, and how these levers are related to each other.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Money...</h2>
                        <p>Importantly, the numbers on the screen are not the levers. The reasoning behind the numbers is where you surface the nature of these key financial ingredients to and interactions of your venture.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Money...</h2>
                        <p>Second, beyond a solid understanding of these levers, you recognize how sensitive the survival of the venture is to certain levels as compared to others. These highly sensitive aspects of the financials are sometime called the &#8220;key drivers&#8221; of the model.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Money...</h2>
                        <p>Third, you have optimistic yet realistic expectations for how your firm could grow over time, both in terms of its sources of income and expense. Furthermore, you recognize when, why, and to what extent you might require additional funding in the future.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>Money...</h2>
                        <p>Finally, you can be trusted with other peoples&#8217; money. You are essentially describing how someone else&#8217;s money will be spent.</p>
