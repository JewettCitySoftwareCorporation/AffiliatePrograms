Just like this book or whatever it may become is a creation I created talking to my laptop while building some affiliate marketing code of my own and you can see It all on GitHub.

New line advertising used to be just for the radio television or newsprint. today most of the world gets their news from the web also many businesses have also moved in migrated to the web and with e-commerce and other and other things the web has become the new Marketplace for business. so if you are a business you have to understand that there is marketing and advertising that needs to be done and this needs to be done in and out of this playground or Marketplace the efforts done with in this Marketplace can be reused and reused and reused over and over again maybe most of the efforts done outside of this Marketplace are not so reusable however the methods and strategies are duplicated. So marketing in in this in this Marketplace requires HTML Which is reusable and you can deploy this code on many different sites. So the effort than once to create this code can then be used day in day out for the remainder of business operations to help Drive traffic or customers to this new opportunity. As you build these templates you should save them and create folders of predefined templates that can be used by you and your team to speed up future projects or efforts on the same project where the goals are the same to drive traffic and advertised your opportunity to new potential customers or drive current customers to repurchase and continue supporting the work and effort you're doing. video 3D web virtual reality simulations and other new things still on The Cutting Edge are fantastic ways to get your brand out there and build awareness in the new in this new Marketplace. Please understand like like the internet brought the change to the encyclopedias and Skype brought change to cell phones and communication and blockchain bought brought change to your wallet and the Federal Reserve 3D web and some of these newer Technologies. videos are currently being used to help Drive traffic and their great ways to inform their user base of how to interact or use your product or the offer you're you're providing. videos can also be used in entertaining purposes and advertisements put on top of the entertainment for within the entertainment. But without users or views this content Weatherby video 3D virtual reality or just plain old HTML you need traffic. traffic comes from backlinks subscribers having a user base of following people interested in your ideas in the things you're trying to do. now most of your customers you don't know you might not meet maybe you do me maybe shake hands but your best customers are the ones you never meet that enjoy the products and services you provide that you spent close to close to $0 to engage with. now the way to cultivate these customers and to help them grow is to provide value and to help solve the problems and issues but they are having and provide the solutions they're looking for and make the process easy transparent and available for them to share with others. this gets back to affiliate marketing. so as affiliate marketer you want others to potentially want to share your content. getting others to share your content in which you are trying to sell them on someone else's brand is a huge win for creating backlinks and in reaching a market you weren't currently engaging with this then enables you to reach new sales potentials and grow your Market pace. while doing all this capturing emails addresses and providing some value to those that decide to take the plunge and join another yet useless email list is a great way to still find customers and to solve their problems and provide value to them with informed messages and timely information to help them Act and be more prosperous in their industry by doing so you can slowly engage with this audience and potential and drive traffic to your opportunities and hopefully increase your conversion ratio.
 conversion ratio
Your conversion ratio is probably one of the most important metrics to know understand measure and track progress of the route your efforts. This ratio determines the percentage of sales you will obtain from the effort you put in to your work. just because you put effort into your work and you think it's the best thing does not mean it will gain traction or the others will use it. this is where the work needs to be companies come into play so that you Taylor you are marketing towards the audience you are directing these opportunity campaigns to. the better targeted these campaigns and the Better Valu provided 2 those engaging with it increases your likelihood for sales as you increase your sales your conversion ratio should rise as well.
 analytics enter Google analytics is a free tool that can be overwhelming but provides massive value for the work you are about to do. you can place a tracking ID from this platform on all of your documents that you plan to share and actually measure the work you're doing and in those that you're engaging with. with these metrics you can make better adjustments on things that are working things that might not be working and potential areas to increase your efforts we're currently might be weak. this when you get into page views and customer awareness just because you've got three million page views does not mean you got 3 million newly informed users or or potential customers that just means that 3 million times your page was loaded in some sort of browser weather be on a machine in a machine virtually or on a machine a human might actually be interacting with no one no one's counting that. So this page views the more page views you have that goes up without sales following directly behind is what creates this conversion ratio would reason of the ratios because it's a percentage as most of the time it's never at or above 100% theoretically it's possible to be over 100% Maybe but you would have to be by you have to have people buying but don't even know it exists or hasn't been presented to you yet so if you could achieve that it's possible but back to the realistic so if you have 75% viewing your offer and finally committing to the purchase is a realistic area. Obviously the higher the number the better off you are and the lower number means the more work you need to do to convince people to purchase. some products in affiliate marketing may tell you a conversion ratio that they have had in the past. But without research and investigating and knowing how they came up with that number to provide it for you you should assume that these numbers are just numbers in a box written in by someone to entice you to want it. Because if I offered you a 110% right and everyone else was saying 80 - 90% who's would you go. But if you did that research and saw that my 110% was was better then sure it's a great purchase but that was from an educated and informed decision. Not all offers out there are fantastic and the money makers may not be something you want to promote. and the things you want to promote may need a bit of persuading or repetitiveness tenacity in urine formation of your customers of this offer. And remember just because they said no once doesn't mean they're going to say no forever but if they said No 5 minutes ago and you're asking them now minutes later I'm pretty sure the answer will be very similar without efforts done to allow them to digest the information previously provided and act on new information provided. the more new information and and value you can provide to these users on a reoccurring occasion there's a way to maintain Perpetual customer acquisition. That's a great topic to get into next. Perpetual customer acquisition. This should be your new job title as an affiliate marketer your goals are simple indefinitely bring new people to an offer you found worth your time and energies an effort to promote.

Freebies enter it cost money to make money if anybody tells you different  walk away. stop listening walk away. So knowing that cost money doesn't mean you have to spend a fortune you can limit budget or plan your expenses to meet the needs of the required Revenue you are trying to. Knowing where your where your goals and targets are helps you plan and align your efforts accordingly. By using really available Technologies you can maximize some of your efforts by eliminating cost that others are engaging in driving down there returns. By using these freebies you are in a sense giving up some sovereignty and this may be acceptable for some projects but not others please keep this in mind.

If your sole intent is to inform and gain others attention then why not use these platforms to help you do so others are doing so. 
 GitHub is probably the first freebie I want to mention as a software developer this is a great and fantastic tool. As a marketer you might not understand it. but if you were trying to deploy a shareable web URL that others can really assess your content then this is a great platform to post your work too and provide you the mechanisms to maintain this project over time.

 YouTube if you've heard others tell you this to you probably should have listened I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here you can find more information from other practitioners out there as I am not a video content creator currently Beyond the occasional things I do with my Contour 2. I have however been creating video content with popcorn Jas utilizing these videos I'm taking with the Contour to become a video practitioner but you need the content. Content is King So if you have content you want to share and you're not afraid of jumping in front of a camera it's only takes you the time it takes to record and upload and you can start reaching a new customer base. If you are already on YouTube and have been posting think about doing video edits and post processing and adding not over-the-top craziness but small little things to say hey I'm trying to provide you value and give back to the community that's taking time to watch your content. Make it entertaining and being formative informative be yourself and the users will come enter. Twitter is also fantastic but you have to have a following and a subscriber base to get the most value. Codepen. IO period for any designers or developers out there is also another great tool you can post marketing in in-game obtainable links to that you can then share and have other back links to support your product. Remember backlinks are one of the key ingredients 2 your success as an affiliate marketer and the sales needed. the more backlinks you have and the more shares of these links by other random users will be how you stand out from your competitors. So using things like codepen dial which are meant to share code pieces could be utilized to share marketing information for advertising information just as well as cold if you happen to splice some code for fancy CSS into it just takes a little bit more effort and helps the final product in the end. enter collaboration enter collaborating with others I feel is a great tool overlooked by many.

There's a saying many hands make light work. Light work is definitely easier than arguing painful excruciating work. And you're more likely to find someone to help you with light work then you are heavy duty work. 

Content creation center we're creating content you should definitely use a CMS AKA content management system these things were built in the purpose for helping you create better web applications. I personally use DNN formerly known as dotnetnuke. why because I am an asp.net developer and I use is information internet Information Services as my web server most of the time. Still don't use Internet Explorer but I am a Microsoft stack developer. DNN was written in asp.net. This enables meet to utilize my skills to extend this platform to provide value to my users however it is also a great platform for any beginner that wants to get started creating web content. 
Domain Management  
 so now you want to host web documents you're going to need a domain name the point is to once you have a domain name and hosting and web content and all this you're going to have a web was called the web presence that you need to manage and proper management and utilization of this intellectual property determines your level of success. the better you can manage these properties create new and interesting content that engages your customers and create sustainable traffic you could then rely on this traffic to draw attention to things you want to Market until you have the traffic you can have the best content in the world and the best offer possible with the lowest price for the consumer and and and all the best parts but without traffic or people finding out about your offer you essentially have no sales so traffic does not correlate to sales directly but indirectly the more traffic the higher percentage or the higher likely chance you have obtaining sales. sales can also be obtained without traffic initially by cultivating your target market and finding those ready to purchase and directing them to your offer and essentially it's like preheating the oven your warm up to your offer and then point them in the direction to purchase.
Yes security should also be a concern if you are collecting any sensitive data. But if you are displaying only marketing information and not connecting to any apis or the like we are sharing secret for sensitive data then security can be ignored as to a degree as there is not much for them to be intrigued to get ahold of. However as soon as you start interacting with apis and other things were data can be sent you run the risk of compromising this data or your business by compromising your business data I'm overlooking something as simple as security. We are an IT services shop and we're not going to get into the security in this if you want help hire us. Other than that do your research formed be proactive.

 affiliate marketing is a great way to earn money and create work for for yourself or team and possibly build a business around your hobbies ideas and things you enjoy doing. First you have to know what you enjoy doing and the things you like and it helps to have others that enjoy these things too. my first boss once told me if you love what you do you never have to work a day in your life and these are words that hit me at an early age and help me realize that yes a lot of people have to go to work everyday to earn a living to make their money while others love what they do help others and Build a Better World in which they want to live in. it's about Choice some people enjoy the work others don't some people are trapped others could be free and not even know. as an affiliate marketer you need to know not only your business but also the businesses you were promoting and the products that you're promoting why you're promoting them the value they provide customers The value of provides the community and how promoting this particular offer will provide for your organization. One product could be enough to help you start generating income but a single product is only a single Revenue stream. It is best to have multiples and having them all work tangentially and in unison for the same results. Your results are to drive traffic and sales for promotions or offers in which you are affiliated with. Your organization also provides some service or value that is affiliated with the community by its existence. So this is an opportunity to utilize one to help the other and the other to help you your business. So if you are a startup and you have limited products or no ideas to sell or nothing concrete yet. You can use other people's ideas and build traffic and sales for the products already created that these businesses have brought to the market and build a base for a following for the future for when after you've done a few and have some experience and ran into some issues in which you feel you can solve and bring a new product to the market then you have a Marketplace to leverage already built and established Turning Away profits and revenues every day on work you did the day before the week before the year before excetera excetera. Because like I said before Once you post your HTML it is up on the server and will exist there until you take it down or stop paying the server for its work. by leveraging this product by this platform you can Vin throw your new project out into the and work on getting customers for this idea. And start tracking its conversion rate and customers and Page traffic and set up a Google analytics account tracking ID and be able to show how you're growing the efforts for your personal work. enter this project is an example to show you. And you will find all of this information I'm talking about like the tracking ID in the code provided.
 paid traffic everyone's going to tell you is the best traffic as you get it as you pay for the more you buy the more you get in the more you get the more you want. now yes like I said before. This is a costly Venture most of the great tools or Services you would want to use to accelerate your efforts will cost you. it is your job as the manager of this new effort to find the ones that are cost-effective and provide the value you need for your efforts. Some platforms Target certain audiences while other platforms Focus on page views rather than conversions and depending upon your business strategy one may be preferable to the other but I don't know about you I'm focusing on conversions and sales.
Grant Cardone Gary V Gary vaynerchuk Anthony Robbins guy Kawasaki Robert Kawasaki price Mike Maloney Peter Schiff you should have listened to at least once And you should be following them and watching what they do. These guys are industry leaders and most of them and they practice what they preach which is important in this industry. Because many people will try to tell you what they think without ever done it. And if you look at any of these guys reputations and what they accomplished you will see that they got there by doing what they're talking about and why are they talking about all the things are talking about you might wonder and why is YouTube and other platforms all clogged up with data all revolving around them and they're talking points and you can hardly find anything else next to all the fake news. Why because they are practice what they preach what are they preaching selling themselves and the products they have to offer. What does that make them I wonder affiliate marketers who are they affiliated with does that matter they are providing value to the people that purchase their products which gives them the customer power to grow and expand while the rest of you are stagnant and complacent absorbing their content wondering why is everybody passing them by. Why they are creating content their content which remember is King is reverting traffic back to their promotions or opportunities they are currently presenting which helps end Drive traffic and potential sales to these offers. the more content they create the more links they have to their offers AKA backlinks remember and the more chances they have for the market to find their offer and engage. So as true salesman they want to continue their growth or potentially have some Spurt of unplanned growth in the future from actions unplanned of users informing themselves on platform and which they previously did a little bit of work and deployed content to so users could find this information and get to the point where they can purchase and become customers providing that passive income stream everyone is trying to build. So if you are not creating content you have less to Market and less backlinks than our competitors and less opportunity to drive people 2 your promotions therefore less sales and lower conversion ratio Les check's in the mail and wondering why it ain't working.
It doesn't matter where you create the content or how you created the issue is you need to create an endless supply of content that is Meaningful and helps the user engage not only with you and your organization and its services but also the matter and provide value to to get these users to keep to promote your offer and help grow your audience. The faster you can grow this audience will be the faster you can obtain your results.
